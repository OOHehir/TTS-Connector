The Things Network

Make Homey part of a global LoRaWAN Network.

This app connects Homey to The Things Network (TTN), using webhooks.

Features include triggers by:
1. Uplink message
2. Uplink message from specific device
3. Uplink message from specific application
4. Gateway going offline and TX/RX statistics (no webhook required)

Note: 
This app does NOT implement loRa on Homey, rather it uses the internet to connect to TTN servers & pass data back & forth. From the TTN servers the data is relayed via LoRaWAN gateways to end devices.
