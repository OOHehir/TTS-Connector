This app connects Homey to The Things Network (TTN) servers using webhooks. The TTN is a global community building a network of loRaWAN devices. 

After installing the app on Homey:
1. Go to the app 'Settings' page. It shows the 'Webhook ID' & 'Keypath Value'.
2. On your TTN console (link on settings page) select: 'Relevant Application> Integrations > Webhooks > '+ Add Webhook'> Homey Template. Fill in the details from step 1.
3. Save!

Once complete data from your end devices can be used by Homey to trigger events & notifications, just like regular devices.
